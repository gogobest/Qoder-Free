  - `scripts/install.sh` for Linux and macOS.
  - `scripts/install.ps1` for Windows PowerShell.
- **Pure CLI / Headless Mode**:
  - Run Qoder-Free directly in terminal without GUI/PyQt5 dependencies using `--cli`, `--reset`, `--status`, `--backup`, `--restore`, `--list-backups`, `--check-update`.
- **Identity Auto-Backup & Restore**:
  - Automated identity backup before reset and 1-click restore capability with `manifest.json`.
  - Added GUI buttons and CLI flags for backup and restore.
- **Update Checker**:
  - In-app and CLI check for latest GitHub releases via official GitHub API.
- **Comprehensive Unit Testing**:
  - Added `test_features.py` covering backup, restore, update checks, and CLI flags.

### Fixed
- Fixed duplicate `is_qoder_running` method definition.
- Made PyQt5 import conditional to enable headless execution.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-07-08

### Added
- Added a copyable diagnostic report for GitHub issue follow-up without exposing token values.
- Added visible app guidance that local resets cannot guarantee server-side trial credits or model access.

### Changed
- Refined the PyQt5 layout for clearer operation grouping, larger responsive buttons, and a more readable log panel.
- Exposed existing login cleanup, hardware reset, GitHub, and diagnostic actions directly in the main UI.
- Deep cleanup and hardware reset buttons now execute the actual cleanup/reset logic instead of only showing success messages.
- Translation lookup now falls back to English for missing keys.

### Removed
- Removed decoy file creation from super deep cleanup to keep reset output easier to verify.

- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Dropped EOL Python 3.7 and 3.8 from test matrix; now covers 3.9, 3.10, 3.11
- **Release Workflow**: Updated `softprops/action-gh-release` to v2 for improved release automation
